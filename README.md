## **Use K-Means Clustering to cluster data for analysis**

* Standardize the data
* Create an Elbow Plot to determine the number of clusters
* Apply the K-Means Clustering model
* Plot the clusters including the centroid for each of the clusters as defined by K-Means
* Plot all of the clusters together with different colors to make it easier to interpret
* Determine the accuracy score if true labels are known
